# Business Problem
Superstore faced challenges in achieving balanced growth across regions, product categories, and customer segments. While certain regions and products demonstrated strong sales and profitability, others underperformed, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities. Additionally, customer behavior analysis revealed gaps in retention and engagement, particularly in lower-performing segments.

## The primary issues included:

**Regional Disparities**: High-performing regions like California and New York drove most profits, whereas regions like Texas and Florida lagged behind in sales and profitability.
**Product Portfolio Inefficiencies**: Certain product categories, such as Office Supplies, exhibited low profit margins, pulling down overall profitability despite steady sales.
**Customer Engagement Gaps**: The Corporate segment generated high sales volume but suffered from higher return rates, impacting profitability, while other segments lacked targeted strategies to improve engagement.
**Inventory and Demand Alignment**: Frequent stockouts in high-demand product categories, particularly during peak seasons, resulted in lost revenue opportunities.

# Goal
*The goal of this Tableau project was to leverage data visualization and analysis to:*

* Identify and address performance gaps across regions, products, and customer segments.
* Enhance inventory management to better align with demand.
* Improve customer engagement and retention strategies to maximize lifetime value.
* Support data-driven decisions to boost profitability and achieve sustainable growth.
